# COEN-ELEC-390

This product aims at improving people's cardio exercise's efficiency by keeping record of user's heart rate before and after the workout. The product consists of an android application, a board which is a microcontroller that has WI-FI interface, and a basic heart rate sensor. Heart rate sensor should be directly attached to human body, and physically connected to the microcontroller. Microcontroller should communicate to an android device and information are displayed on the device.

The 1st sprint objective is to have a deliverable product that could demonstrate some basic functionalities, including displaying the heart rate in real-time. Implement an algorithm that calculate cardio exercise's efficiency tailored to the end-users.

The 2nd sprint objective is to get many metrics from the phone, as the user's location, speed. Also, we want the user to be able to use the application while being offline. Finally, we would like to have a sharing page for people to post their results and motivate one another.

The 3rd sprint objective is to get the remaining metrices that were left in sprint 2, such as Step counter and a snapshot of run session that contains user's average speed, calories burned, performance index and user's running path. The picture can be shared in different social media. We also want to add encryption on our database to protect user's information.
