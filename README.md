This product aims at improving people's cardio exercise's efficiency by keeping record of user's heart rate during the workout. The product consists of an android application, a board which is a microcontroller that has WI-FI interface, and a basic heart rate sensor. Heart rate sensor should be directly attached to human body, and physically connected to the microcontroller. Microcontroller should communicate to an android device and information are displayed on the device.

The final objective is to have a deliverable product that could demonstrate some basic functionalities, including displaying the heart rate in real-time. Implement an algorithm that calculate cardio exercise's efficiency tailored to the end-users.
